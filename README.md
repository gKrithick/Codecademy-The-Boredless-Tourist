# Codecademy-The-Boredless-Tourist
The Boredless Tourist is an online application giving you the power to find the parts of the city that fit the pace of your life. The Boredless Tourist run a recommendation engine using Python. We first evaluate what a person’s interests are and then give them recommendations in their area to venues, restaurants, and historical destinations that we think they’ll be engaged by.
This project since it comes as a learning part in the Codecademy's Computer Science part, is been divided into different parts. which means, we just don't get right into the solution rather it's a step-by-step code
