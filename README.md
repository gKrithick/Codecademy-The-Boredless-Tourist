# Python Fundamentals. Project. The Boredless Tourist

The Boredless Tourist is an online application that allows you to identify portions of the city that suit your lifestyle. The Boredless Tourist uses Python to run a recommendation engine. We assess a person's interests before making recommendations in their area for events, restaurants, and historical sites that we believe may pique their interest.
